## NYT News Reader serves as a platform for readers to access a current list of NYT articles. From this app, a reader can view article details, such as the its abstract and byline, and obtain a link to read the full story on the New York Time's website. This news reader also allows readers to filter stories based on subcategory.

### This application was created to submit as a Mod 4 take-home project for Turing School of Software & Design. 
You can see it in action by visiting the [My News Reader](https://rlh-nyt-news-reader.surge.sh/) or on your local computer by following the instructions below. <br><br>

## Goals

- Simulate a take-home task one mighty receive during an interview process
- Create a news reader application that pulls articles from the [NYT Top Stories API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/top-stories-product/1/overview)
- At minimum, the app should show:
  - A list of articles
  - A “detailed” view for each article
  - Articles in the list must link to the detailed article view
  - Filter feature
- Demonstrate a strong understanding of React JS/Front End best practices
- Prioritize project for MVP

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo down to your machine
2. Open the root directory and rum `npm i` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to initialize the webpage
4. Open the site by copying and pasting the server location `http://localhost:3000` in you address bar

## Development Process

### As a visual learner with an associates in graphic design, I operate best when I can conceptualize how the project would look and operate. My News Reader began life as Figma wireframes to provide direction on how I want to structure my code and app functionality.

* Please note I originally envisioned a bookmarking feature be included with this project. This was abandoned in order to meet the constraints of the MVP.

### Next came the component tree structure:
